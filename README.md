# OpenCoolshit
*Very cool name, i know*


OpenCoolshit is an addon made for the [1.16.5 port of OpenComputers](https://github.com/KosmosPrime/OpenComputers/) that ports some cool stuff to 1.16.5 and bundles it together, we also plan to add some of our own content in the future.

This mod was created for our private server, but if you want to use it you can.

The only port currently being worked on is that of [OpenSolidstate by ShadowKatStudios](https://github.com/ShadowKatStudios/OpenSolidState/).

### OpenSolidState

This mod adds stuff like flash drives, general purpose (E)EPROMS and SoC's. In the process of porting this mod, we did take some liberties in changing functionality, however all assets are the same.

The mod did not contain a license so i'm not sure if we're allowed to port this. If you are the owner of OpenSolidstate, please contact me on discord if you are upset that we used your assets.
